# Tree Models

This directory contains 3D tree models for the virtual tour inventory.

## Required Files:
- tree1.glb - Tropical Palm tree model
- tree2.glb - Mangrove tree model

## File Format:
- Use .glb format for best performance with Three.js
- Models should be optimized for web (< 5MB each)
- Include animations if available

## Sources for Tree Models:
- Sketchfab (Creative Commons)
- Poly Haven
- Quixel Megascans
- Custom modeling in Blender

For now, the component will show placeholder geometries until actual GLB files are added.
